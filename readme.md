***The Chill Guy Port Scanner by yk.** It’s not just a scanner. It’s a vibe.*

---

## 🚀 What’s This?

This is the **Chill Guy Port Scanner** — a lightweight, sarcastically chill, and surprisingly powerful port scanner written in pure Bash. No bloated tools. No dependencies. Just you, your terminal, and a bunch of open (or very closed) ports.

It’s like `nmap`, but with zero commitment and full-on **chill energy**.

## 🎯 Features

* 😎 **ASCII Banner** – Because scanning is better with style.
* 🎨 **Colored Output** – Know what’s up at a glance.
* ⚡ **Fast Scanning with Parallel Connections** – We don’t wait. We vibe.
* 🧫 **Custom Port Range & Specific Port Selection** – Your scan, your rules.
* 📦 **Log File Export** – For when you want receipts.
* 🔊 **Live Output While Scanning** – No ghosting. You see every port, as it happens.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Bash
* Netcat (`nc`)
* A chill attitude
* Linux / MacOS (WSL works too, Windows cmd? bro…)

---

## 🧪 How to Use

```bash
chmod +x chillscanner.sh
./chillscanner.sh
```

And then? Just follow the prompt like a good little hacker. Choose scan types, port ranges, or feed it your special list of ports like:

> “Hey bro, can you check 22, 80, and 443?”
> — "Yeah fam, I gotchu."

---

## 🔧 Example Use Cases

```bash
# Default scan (common ports)
./chillscanner.sh

# Custom range
Scan from port 20 to 1000

# Specific ports
Scan: 21,22,25,53,80,443,3306

# Export results
Logs saved like a diary for your ports
```

## 💀 Warning

This script was written by a chill guy.
It doesn't do stealth.
It doesn't ask for permission.
So maybe don't aim it at your college servers or FBI.gov unless you're **cool with consequences**.

---

## ✨ Why tho?

> *Because sometimes you just want to see if port 22 is open without launching a whole cyber war.*

---

## 📂 Output Sample

```bash
Port 22 is OPEN
Port 80 is OPEN
Port 443 is CLOSED
```
